# IT700 Capstone â€“ Virtual Events Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for my capstone project in IT 700: Capstone in Information Technology. 
The goal of the project is to develop a scalable Java-based backend system to support virtual events for small organizations 
such as university clubs and nonprofits.

## Technologies Used
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot (REST API)
- MySQL
- Spring Data JPA
- Postman (for testing)
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git + GitHub

## Project Structure
- `controller/`: REST API endpoints
- `service/`: Business logic
- `repository/`: Data access layer
- `model/`: Domain models/entities
- `resources/`: Configuration files

## Purpose
This backend is designed to be lightweight, maintainable, and scalable, enabling small teams to manage users, events, and session Q&A features efficiently.

This project is part of my IT 700 Capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University
